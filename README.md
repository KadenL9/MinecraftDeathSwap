# MinecraftDeathSwap Plugin About

A Minecraft plugin for spigot and bukkit servers. Based on the classic Minecraft Death Swap where players swap positions and try to kill each other.

# Rules and Mechanics

## Basic Rules

1.) There must be at least 2 players for Minecraft Death Swap to work.

2.) The goal of Minecraft Death Swap is to get the other peson killed when you swap positions before you are killed.

3.) Players are not allowed to enter the nether or the end so it isn't too easy to kill the other players.

4.) At the start of the game, there will be a set time of 5 minutes before the first swap to allow players to obtain necessary materials for survival such as wood, food, and resources.

5.) After the first swap, players will swap positions after a random time between 1 and 3 minutes in which they will have time to set up traps and such.

6.) At the beginning of the game, all settings are set to default survival.

## Swap Mechanics Based on Number of Players
Depending on the number of players, the swapping mechanic will work slightly differently.

In the case of __one player__, the plugin will not start the game at all unless there are 2 or more people online.

In the case of __two players__, players will swap with each other's positions. The first player to die will lose and the other player will win.

In the case of __three players__, players will swap with a set location. For example, if there is player 1, 2, and 3, player 1 will always teleport to player 2's location, player 2 will always swap to player 3's location, and player 3 will always swap to player 1's location.

In the case of __four or more players__, players will swap in random locations. Each location will still be teleported to once by only one player; however, randomizing the destinations gives a small chance of some players to not teleport at all since they are "teleporting" to their own location.

# Inspiration

This plugin is inspired by Dream, a famous minecraft youtuber, who has used the Death Swap plugin in a few of his Youtube videos. This plugin is my own take on the classic Death Swap plugin. It is basically the same except I have added my own custom features and may have changed it slightly.
